Hi, as a passionate advocate for artificial intelligence in medicine, I lead transformative initiatives at the intersection of deep learning and healthcare. In my role as a Pathologist at the James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital and Chief AI Officer for the VA Sunshine Healthcare Network (VISN 8), in addition to my diagnostic work, I drive the implementation of cutting-edge technologies to enhance veteran care delivery and clinical outcomes. With an academic appointment as Professor of Pathology, Medicine, and Surgery at the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, I am dedicated to preparing the next generation of healthcare professionals for an AI-augmented future. My work focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical advances in machine learning and practical clinical applications, ensuring that emerging technologies serve to augment and elevate the standard of patient care. Through research, education, and clinical implementation, I strive to shape a healthcare landscape where artificial intelligence is a powerful tool to support clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.
